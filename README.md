# Personal Portfolio Site

Welcome to my personal portfolio site! This site was built using Django (a Python web framework) and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on any device
- Interactive elements using JavaScript
- Blog section featuring posts about my projects and experiences
- Image gallery showcasing my past work
- Contact form for easily getting in touch with me

## Setup

To run this site locally, you will need to have Python and Django installed.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the following command to set up the database and create an administrative user:

``` 

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

5. Start the development server with the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

6. The site should now be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Deployment

To deploy this site to a live server, you will need to set up a Django production environment. Here are the general steps for doing so:

1. Install the necessary packages and libraries on the server
2. Set up a web server (such as Apache or Nginx) to serve the site
3. Set up a database (such as PostgreSQL) for the site
4. Collect the static files in the project (such as CSS and JavaScript) into one location
5. Configure the web server to serve these static files and proxy requests to the Django application

Please note that this is just a general overview of the deployment process, and there are many specific details that will depend on your server environment and hosting provider.
