        As a Python/Django Full Stack Web Development Teaching Assistant at
        Columbia Business School, I have trained over 75 students in technical
        skills and computer science fundamentals. I have also mentored students
        in project management, product development, and collaborative skill
        building, and contributed to curriculum design by gathering and
        analyzing student feedback.<br /><br />

        Prior to this role, I was a Shipping and Receiving Supervisor at Killer
        Merch LLC - Jeffree Star Cosmetics, where I coordinated and supervised a
        team of 20 members, cross-trained over 50 team members across several
        departments, and was responsible for the movement and security of over
        $10 million worth of merchandise each day. I also served as a Shipping
        and Receiving Lead, managing all aspects of product inventory, leading
        and participating in projects to optimize operational efficiency, and
        directing cargo loading.<br /><br />

        In my personal projects, I have designed and written a relational
        database schema using SQLite, Django, and Python, contributed to full
        stack code development, acted as project lead and code reviewer, built
        wireframes using Miro, and created user experience flows. I have also
        designed entity-relationship diagrams to demonstrate database
        relationships and business logic. Additionally, I have built a personal
        portfolio website using Python and Django, deployed with PythonAnywhere,
        added additional features and functionality, and implemented responsive
        frontend design using Bootstrap.<br /><br />

        I am skilled in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, React,
        pair programming, code review, technical mentorship, technical
        communication, Git, Github, OOP, data structures, debugging, deployment,
        problem solving, critical thinking, data entry management, supply chain
        management, and Acumatica. I also possess strong leadership and time
        management skills.
